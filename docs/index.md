### Introduction

  In recent years, wooden house are mostly pre-fabricated in factories and assemble on-site.
Therefore, the pre-assembly stage remains a crucial to the success of each construction. One important part of this pre-assembly stage is the fixation of metal fittings(kanamono) in wood frames for future assembly. Each of these metal fittings is thoroughly chosen thinking about the length, width and emplacement of the wood frame as well as the structure of the house. Even though, the type and quantity of kanamono going into each woodframe is listed in advance, the tedious process of pick placing kanamono remains a difficult challenge for workers. This manual operation takes 3-4 hours a day and humans are prone to mistake. 
  Thus, in this project, we aim to build a physical structure and a system to completely automate the picking and placing metal fittings. For this purpose, we use a Mitsubishi Robot RV-5AS-D for grasping and stowing kanamono, a set of Keyence made sensors, air cylinders and a Mitsubishi PLC FX5U-32 for I/O control. Finally we build a computer program to manage the overall system.


### Objective

This Kanamono picking system aims to detect pick, weigh and place metal fittings in boxes according to a work list sent to the robot. Then, using a conveyer system, the boxes are transported and arrange in shelves before being, later on, picked up by workers when needed. <br>
